        <strong>Computational fluid dynamics <em>(CFD)</em></strong> is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows.<br><br>Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid (liquids and gases) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.<br><br>With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems.<br><br>Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows.<br><br>Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels.<br><br>In addition, previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.<br><br>A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as flight tests.

        <span>CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including aerodynamics and aerospace analysis, weather simulation, natural science and environmental engineering, industrial system design and analysis, biological engineering, fluid flows and heat transfer, and engine and combustion analysis.</span> The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the Navier–Stokes equations, which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows. These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing viscous actions to yield the Euler equations. Further simplification, by removing terms describing vorticity yields the full potential equations. Finally, for small perturbations in subsonic and supersonic flows (not transonic or hypersonic) these equations can be linearized to yield the linearized potential equations.

            Methodology
          </h4>
          <p>
            In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
            <ul>
              <li>During preprocessing
                <ol>
                  <br><li>The geometry and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using computer aided design (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted.</li>
                  <li>The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.</li>
                  <li>The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation</li>
                  <li>Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.</li><br>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <br><li>The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient</li><br>
              <br><li>Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.</li><br>
            </ul>
